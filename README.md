Analysis on relationship data
Employed supervised and unsupervised learning models to on romantic relationship data

Used sklearnâ€™s K-means algorithm for finding clusters of couples that matched in a speed dating event.
Employed t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (TSNE) to map data points from high dimensional space to 2D and 3D.
Each point represented a couple.

Used feed forward neural network. I experimented with different layers until i got right one during training.

Results to the supervise analysis are [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAD8uY7mWSg/whtrA992qguxSQlrPupugw/view?utm_content=DAD8uY7mWSg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)
